    "# Financial Data Collection using Yahoo Finance\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a script for collecting financial data using Yahoo Finance. It follows these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Importing necessary libraries.\n",
    "2. Collecting S&P 500 symbols.\n",
    "3. Defining the period for historical data.\n",
    "4. Filtering valid symbols (symbols avalaible on the Wikipedia list from which you can access that in the given period).\n",
    "5. Collecting data for valid symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Importing Necessary Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import yfinance as yf # Free API to get stock data\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Collecting S&P 500 Symbols\n",
    "\n",
    "The script reads symbols of S&P 500 companies from a Wikipedia page and stores them in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sp500_symbols = pd.read_html(\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies\")[0]['Symbol'].tolist()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Defining the Period for Historical Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we define the time period for which we want to collect historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "start_date = \"2018-01-01\"\n",
    "end_date = \"2019-01-01\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Filtering Symbols\n",
    "\n",
    "The script filters valid and empty symbols by getting historical data for each symbol and verifying its availability, while trying not to overload the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "valid_symbols = []\n",
    "invalid_symbols = []\n",
    "\n",
    "for symbol in sp500_symbols:\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # Code to get data goes here\n",
    "        if not data.empty:\n",
    "            valid_symbols.append(symbol)\n",
    "    except:\n",
    "        # Handling invalid symbols\n",
    "        invalid_symbols.append(symbol)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Additional Steps After Filtering Symbols\n",
    "\n",
    "### Saving Data for Valid Symbols\n",
    "\n",
    "For each symbol in `valid_symbols`, we fetch its data with a 1d period (that you can change) and append it to a CSV file named 'data_stock.csv', including the date data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data = yf.download(valid_symbols, period=\"1d\", start=start_date, end=end_date, auto_adjust=True)['Close']\n",
    "data = data.reset_index()\n",
    "data.to_csv(\"data/raw_data/data_stock.csv\", index=False)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Storing Invalid Symbols\n",
    "\n",
    "The list of `invalid_symbols` is written into a text file named 'invalid_symbols.txt'.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"data/raw_data/invalid_symbols.txt\", \"w\") as f:\n",
    "    f.write(\"\\n\".join(invalid_symbols))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this process, you will have a CSV file `data_stock.csv` with data for all valid symbols and a text file `invalid_symbols.txt` containing the symbols for which data was not available.\n"
